# mission_to_mars
So this repo is not in the best shape. The ScraperFactory class runs like a top.
All of the scrapers function as they are meant to and return the required data. 

The database is also only barely fuctional I was able to store one dictionary of dictionaries
returned from the factory.

The flask app is also only barely funtional. I was able, at one point, to get the mars news dictionary
returned from the factory to show up in the index.html albeit in a disorganized and unsatisfactory
way. 

My initial plan, and what ended up derailing my progress, was to write an additional class to 
control the mongo controler. I had a vision of a unified file system that could be run with
one command from the command line. 

Clearly I'm looking to avoid an incomplete by turning in the repo in this condition. If I have
failed to meet the most basic requirements please let me know.
